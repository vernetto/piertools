memories together the Jones family

44
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,360
decided to explore the Nutty putty caves

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,000
unaware of the devastating loss they

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,360
were about to face this is the harrowing

account of the Nutty putty cave tragedy

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,719
Jon Jones was ready to spend some joyful

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,399
time with his family when he decided to

50
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,600
explore the Nutty putty cave located in

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,720
Utah's desert near Salt Lake City John

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,120
had never been to this particular cave

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,920
before though he and his brother Josh

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,040
had spent plenty of time exploring

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,080
various caves around Utah during their

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,120
childhood considering himself an

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,000
experienced cave Explorer John said

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,519
although my exploring had slowed down

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,720
over the last few years I got married

60
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,120
had a child and was currently studying

61
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,000
medicine at the University of Virginia

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,360
these commitments kept his schedule

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,640
extremely busy leaving little time for

64
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,080
cave exploring over the Thanksgiving

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,360
holidays he returned home to relax with

66
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,800
his family and had planned a day of

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,480
hiking and exploring at nutty putty a

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,280
cave known to most as a beginner's cave

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
the main sections of the cave held an

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,000
Allure for everyone there was a maze

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,519
room with multiple paths and tunnels

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,640
around large Boulders there was also a

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,400
large sloped area called the slide where

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,879
the entire room tilt tilted at a 45°

75
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,640
angle with a rope to help descend this

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,959
cave system was well mapped in most

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,280
explored areas yet some famous sections

78
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,280
remained more challenging like the birth

79
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,159
canal or the aorta crawl these areas

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,319
were narrow and hard to pass through so

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,480
only the more experienced cavers would

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,599
attempt to navigate them despite the

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,200
known challenges people would still get

84
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,599
stuck in these tight tunnels nutty putty

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,560
had only recently reopened to the public

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,720
after after being closed for several

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,920
years due to many cavers getting trapped

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,480
in these difficult narrow passages for

89
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,760
some these tunnels were navigable but

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,640
for others their shoulders or hips

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,239
couldn't fit through no matter how hard

92
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,720
they tried once trapped in a narrow area

93
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,519
they would need serious help to be

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,000
pulled out because of these rescues a

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,879
new permit system had been put in place

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,760
requiring each group to have at least

97
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,599
two experienced cavers Josh obtained a

98
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,519
permit for a group exploration on

99
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:07,879
Tuesday November 24th 2009 for

100
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,360
Thanksgiving John's pregnant wife Emily

101
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,760
stayed home with their one-year-old

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,040
daughter Lizzie to enjoy a more relaxed

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,079
evening with her in-laws their group of

104
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,720
11 family and friends started in the

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,000
main open sections of the cave but

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
eventually John and his brother Josh

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,280
decided to take two friends along to

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,880
explore the challenging tunnels they had

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,280
heard stories about the birth canal and

110
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,199
consulted the map for its location

111
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,919
this was a long and narrow passage with

112
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,520
an exceptionally tight spot near the end

113
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,600
if they could just make it through the

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,360
narrowest part there would be a small

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,360
room where they could stand up and turn

116
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,919
around they knew the birth canal would

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,600
be tight and potentially disorienting

118
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,479
even for experienced cavers they decided

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,039
to spread out on different paths to

120
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,560
locate this particular tunnel John and

121
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,800
Josh chose a small tunnel to the left

122
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,520
advancing about 15 ft this passage wound

123
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,440
about 10 ft with several up and downs in

124
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,479
height there were a few outer Rock

125
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,720
layers and tight spots that required the

126
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,360
caver to contort their body in various

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,759
ways it wasn't just a matter of pulling

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
oneself through with brute strength this

129
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,199
area was known as the cork screw because

130
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
those who had passed through were small

131
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,160
and flexible using all their skills to

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,600
slowly work their way through its

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,240
nerve-wracking twists after the cork

134
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,960
screw area the path turns up about 5 ft

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,560
and then sharply to the left into a

136
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,919
rocky crevice at a 90° angle so far

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,240
cavers had used this small section as a

138
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,000
turnaround point if needed 5 years

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,520
earlier a 16-year-old boy named Brock

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Clark had gotten stuck in this very cork

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,120
screw section he was only 5' 7 in and

142
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,199
weighed 140 lb yet he got stuck when he

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,840
tried to turn it took 14 hours to free

144
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,000
him John was now in the same spot where

145
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,080
Brock had gotten stuck attempting to

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,680
turn standing 6 ft tall and weighing 200

147
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,560
lb Jon realized that turning in this

148
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,800
section of the tunnel was simply not an

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,319
option for him he found himself in a

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,039
space that was only 12 in high where

151
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,400
there wasn't enough room for his pressed

152
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,680
body to turn around he pushed forward

153
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
toward the Liz area and squeezed himself

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
above it it was a tight spot but he felt

155
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,319
there might be an open space below he

156
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
pulled his stomach in and moved himself

157
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,360
forward through the narrow passage

158
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,720
pulling himself along the Rocks he was

159
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,280
now moving head first downward but a

160
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,880
turn ahead seemed promising what Jon

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,560
didn't know was that no one had ever

162
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,360
passed through this Liz area he was in

163
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,599
completely Uncharted Territory despite

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,639
being in such a cramped and

165
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,560
uncomfortable position Jon kept calm he

166
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,759
firmly believed there would be an open

167
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,960
space ahead he thought he was in part of

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,800
the birth canal where many cavers had

169
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,479
gotten stuck in the narrow tunnel but

170
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,879
eventually made it out safely as he

171
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,759
crossed through a tight area he began to

172
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,120
slide toward the lower part of this

173
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,960
tunnel he was almost doing a handstand

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,759
trying to keep his body steady while

175
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,280
pushing back he still couldn't turn and

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,599
now he was upside down gravity was

177
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,720
pulling his 200lb body against the

178
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,199
weakening strength of his hands he

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
called out to his brother Josh telling

180
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,240
him that he needed to back out they

181
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,440
discussed their options and decided it

182
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,080
was best to move forward and attempt to

183
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,520
turn at this point he was on the verge

184
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,520
of falling onto his shoulders and head

185
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,599
and he had to do something to get out of

186
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,560
this vertical position position his

187
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,599
headlamp gave him a glimpse of a hole in

188
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,879
the floor ahead that might lead to a

189
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,759
larger space feeling a bit more

190
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,919
optimistic he thought about how they

191
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,240
would be laughing about this amazing

192
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,039
experience at Thanksgiving dinner he

193
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,319
made a slight turn and headed toward the

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,520
hole it wasn't clear how he ended up in

195
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,240
that tunnel's hole it seemed he had

196
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,639
slipped hit his head and become stuck in

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,720
the tight spot another possibility was

198
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
that he had peaked into the hole but

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,159
misunderstood what he saw thinking it

200
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,159
was an open when it was merely a closed

201
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,800
space in any case Jon found himself in a

202
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,479
small hole at the bottom of the tunnel

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,639
impossibly narrow at only 18 in wide and

204
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,199
10 in high slightly larger than a laptop

205
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,520
screen he was almost completely upside

206
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,800
down and wedged at a 70° angle he spent

207
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,319
some time trying to get out of this hole

208
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,879
it was exhausting his hands were trapped

209
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,319
in a useless position one beneath his

210
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,879
chest and the other down on the Rock he

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,680
pushed against the walls and soon

212
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,760
realized that all his efforts would not

213
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
be enough to pull him back up through

214
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,360
that tight tunnel his calves and legs

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,240
were still free in the passage but his

216
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,800
feet were now stuck in the narrowest

217
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,080
part of the hole which was only 8 in

218
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
wide he started calling out to Josh

219
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,640
again his voice echoing in the dark

220
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,000
confined space his brother knew that Jon

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,160
was trying to turn which didn't bode

222
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,640
well given the precarious situation they

223
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,760
were in Josh made his way back through

224
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,800
the corkscrew route but unlike his

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,880
brother he decided to go in feet first

226
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,720
this time he carefully maneuvered his

227
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,240
way forward each movement cautious

228
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,279
knowing the risks involved he continued

229
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,680
to move in the direction of Jon's voice

230
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,600
until he reached above the Liz area he

231
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,079
spotted Jon's foot protruding from the

232
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,200
rock as if it was completely swallowed

233
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,880
by it a sight that sent a wave of

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,720
concern through him he slowly Advanced

235
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,839
until his feet caught hold of one of

236
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,279
Jon's legs with a sense of urgency he

237
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,560
tried to p p and lift while Jon pushed

238
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,800
from his side after several feudal

239
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,040
attempts both were exhausted and

240
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,760
frustrated their strength waning as the

241
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,920
minutes ticked by Josh realized the

242
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,800
seriousness of the situation and that

243
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,440
they would need professional help to get

244
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,680
Jon out they agreed that Josh should go

245
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,000
for help while Jon needed to remain as

246
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,760
calm and relaxed as possible during this

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
challenging time while he went for

248
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,000
assistance one of the other friends from

249
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,959
the family entered the area so that Jon

250
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,839
could know he wasn't alone

251
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,240
offering some comfort in that dark

252
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,680
moment Jon remained stuck upside down

253
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,560
focusing mostly on his breathing each

254
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,519
shallow inhale a reminder of the

255
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,399
tightness around his chest the

256
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
constriction made it increasingly

257
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,800
difficult to take anything more than

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,800
shallow breaths all his efforts to move

259
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,880
up only pushed him deeper into the

260
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,920
crevice heightening his anxiety over

261
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,160
time gravity continued to pull his

262
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,320
fatigued body against the rough walls of

263
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,680
the tunnel each moment feeling like an

264
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,680
eternity when help arrived the first

265
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,399
caving rescuer Susan Mata reached the

266
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,519
spot where JN was trapped it was now

267
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,959
12:30 a.m. and John had been upside down

268
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:46,720
for 3 hours the situation becoming

269
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,839
increasingly dire Susan was only 5' 3 in

270
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,160
tall which made it easier for her to

271
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,720
navigate the corkscrew area she had

272
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,040
ropes tied around her ankles so if she

273
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,320
got stuck she would be secured a

274
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,040
precautionary measure that reassured her

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,360
she assessed John situation quickly her

276
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,519
professional instincts kicking in and

277
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,079
told him they were going to get him out

278
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,839
it must have brought him some relief to

279
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,000
know that professional help had finally

280
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,480
arrived and that he would soon be free

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,720
from this daunting predicament Susan

282
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,240
strapped webbing around his legs and

283
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,320
then sent them down from the beginning

284
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,120
of the tunnel several attempts were made

285
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,600
to pull Jon back up using the ropes but

286
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,839
the friction on the ropes made it

287
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,880
impossible to effectively free him

288
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,760
leaving them frustrated he was

289
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,959
completely stuck without the use of his

290
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,399
hands feeling the weight of his

291
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,600
helplessness after some attempts and

292
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,760
considering several aggressive options

293
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,440
they decided to employ a pulley system

294
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,600
to lift Jon out hoping it would work

295
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,120
where their previous efforts had failed

296
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,160
the pulley had been successfully used 5

297
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,399
years prior when Brock Clark got stuck a

298
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,959
piece of equipment that brought a

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,399
glimmer of hope to The Rescuers while

300
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,959
they had a plan to help the space was

301
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,480
not easy to work in with every movement

302
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,160
requiring careful consider itation each

303
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
tool had to be brought in from the

304
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,600
entrance which took about an hour to

305
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
reach the other side of the cork screw

306
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,079
the tunnel was extremely tight and only

307
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,279
small power tools could be transported

308
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,760
in and out complicating their rescue

309
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,079
efforts only one person could assist at

310
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,639
a time and they had to be small or lean

311
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,320
enough to navigate the passage

312
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,279
effectively it was far from an ideal

313
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,120
situation and time was running out every

314
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,079
pulley installation was taking an

315
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,240
extraordinary amount of time during this

316
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,519
the cave Rescuers were trying to engage

317
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,760
JN in conversation comforting him and

318
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,519
sharing stories to keep him calm and

319
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,480
talking he was a devoted Mormon singing

320
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,399
and praying to find peace in this

321
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,880
unbelievable situation John had spent

322
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,000
the night upside down and his body was

323
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,560
showing signs of the physical limits of

324
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,600
staying in this position the human body

325
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,000
is not designed to remain upside down

326
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,360
for extended periods the entire

327
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,519
circulatory system is designed to move

328
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,079
blood forward by the beating of the

329
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,800
heart while valves and tendons prevent

330
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,880
blood from pooling or flowing backward

331
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,079
it balances the one-way flow of fluid

332
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,760
gravity and valves to ensure oxygen is

333
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,720
available to all tissues and the toxins

334
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,959
are removed from the body through the

335
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,600
kidneys Jon's body had been fighting

336
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,720
against gravity for over 12 hours the

337
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,519
brain is not built to endure this kind

338
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,639
of fluid pressure fluid was accumulating

339
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,120
in his lungs and talk toxins were

340
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,480
building up due to a lack of proper

341
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,120
circulation his organs were pressing

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,680
against his lungs making each breath an

343
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,560
exhausting effort as his muscles weren't

344
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,240
made for such tasks his breaths were

345
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,600
slowing and he was completely fatigued

346
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,639
from the effort throughout the night he

347
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,399
had shifted from being completely calm

348
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,680
and clear-headed to helplessly flailing

349
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,399
his legs and hallucinating it was

350
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,720
heartbreaking for The Rescuers to

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,160
witness they felt helpless exhausted and

352
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,440
trapped themselves the air in the cave

353
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,560
system was hot and humid when you're

354
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,759
limited and can't breathe properly

355
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,560
taking a peaceful breath Demands a

356
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,199
concerted effort but The Rescuers knew

357
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,240
that when necessary they could

358
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,680
eventually get out John didn't have that

359
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,959
luxury he couldn't expand his chest to

360
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,160
breathe and the air around him was

361
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,800
gradually losing its oxygen

362
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,440
concentration meanwhile a wireless

363
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,600
Telecom system was brought to the

364
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,160
location where Jon was trapped

365
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,839
his wife spoke to him encouraging him to

366
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,600
be patient and keep the faith John

367
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,600
assured her that he would soon be with

368
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,279
her by then it was 4:00 a.m. and they

369
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,959
had finally succeeded in placing the

370
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,800
pulleys to lift him Ryan shirtz was in

371
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,279
the tunnel when the system was prepared

372
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,000
for testing Jon's body was stuck in the

373
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,720
narrow section of the crevice so Ryan

374
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,399
had to push his legs upward while the

375
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,639
team pulled from outside with every pull

376
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,600
he was hoisted inch by inch by this time

377
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,839
John was experiencing unbearable pain in

378
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
his legs the Rope had been tied around

379
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,880
his feet for hours as The Rescuers tried

380
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,959
various methods to get him out his legs

381
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,759
had turned completely blue and there was

382
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,440
no discernable pulse still with every

383
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,720
pull he asked them to stop as his nerves

384
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,680
had become extremely sensitive they gave

385
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,839
him a moment to collect himself and then

386
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,320
tried again it seemed to be working Jon

387
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,199
was finally being pulled out of the hole

388
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,519
he was raised high enough for Ryan to

389
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,360
approach his leg

390
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,720
and pass him a tube to drink some

391
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,199
Gatorade this attempt was excruciatingly

392
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,880
slow and everyone could feel the fatigue

393
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,519
from this grueling effort Ryan was

394
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,440
wedged in the 12-in high tunnel with his

395
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,399
neck close to Jon's legs as they slowly

396
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,720
tried to extract him from the tight

397
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,800
10-in fissure although they were making

398
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,399
some progress in lifting him they were

399
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,759
still far from getting him out

400
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,880
completely Jon's feet were hitting the

401
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,720
upper ceiling of the tunnel making it

402
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,839
impossible to maneuver them in that

403
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,480
space he had no control over his legs at

404
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,160
this point after spending 19 hours

405
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,519
upside down John's knees were being

406
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,399
gently bent without his help they

407
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,680
seriously considered breaking his legs

408
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,000
to bring him back into the tunnel as

409
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,639
time was quickly running out for John

410
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,920
Suddenly a sharp pain hit Ryan and he

411
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,959
fainted when he came to he was bleeding

412
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,120
profusely and feeling incredibly

413
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,079
disoriented the rope that anchored the

414
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,720
pulley to the Cave's natural Arch had

415
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,240
snapped sending the Carabiner and pulley

416
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,319
crashing directly into Ryan's face he

417
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,839
sustained injuries to his face lips and

418
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:41,160
tongue as well as a concussion he needed

419
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,759
to get out of there quickly Jon found

420
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,360
himself back in the same spot completely

421
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,920
stuck in the tunnel his arms devoid of

422
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,199
blood circulation and his legs were

423
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,639
completely numb he was unable to free

424
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,800
himself in any way this moment marked

425
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,279
the beginning of Jon Jones's ultimate

426
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,639
defeat while Ryan was checked in the pit

427
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,000
and then sent to the hospital his father

428
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,319
Dave came to take Ryan's place in the

429
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,760
tunnel with John it took an hour to

430
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,720
reestablish the pulley lines and Dave

431
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,720
struggled to wrap a rope around Jon's

432
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,400
body but he couldn't manage to get the

433
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,439
Rope around Jon's trapped torso for the

434
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,199
entire time that Dave was with JN he was

435
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,600
unresponsive throughout this whole

436
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,959
ordeal Jon needed assistance for an

437
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,559
effective rescue lifting his 200 lb 6-t

438
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,919
frame without his help was simply

439
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,760
impossible during Dave's attempts to buy

440
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,840
IND John he too found himself stuck for

441
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,799
about 15 minutes this serious effort to

442
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,280
save Jon's life put both him and his son

443
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,120
at risk this was a devastating reality

444
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,480
as he pushed himself into the 12-in

445
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,240
tunnel he grew exhausted and needed to

446
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,400
get out of there Brandon coils took his

447
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,480
place and brought a telecom system to

448
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,280
connect with Jon's family his wife Emily

449
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,840
expressed her love and told him to rest

450
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,039
for a while after all their efforts he

451
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,200
genuinely believed he would make it out

452
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,640
but Brandon could see what she could not

453
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,640
Jon was no longer responding and there

454
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
had been no signs of life from him in

455
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,840
the past few hours Ryan reported that

456
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,679
Jon had been breathing in a wheezing

457
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,799
manner but now there was silence the

458
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,559
rescue team gathered in the pit area of

459
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,280
the cave to discuss the situation it was

460
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,120
decided that a medical professional

461
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,600
would be sent in to confirm whether he

462
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,600
had truly passed away a paramedic was

463
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,120
sent into the tight space to make this

464
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,679
confirmation on Wednesday no nober 25th

465
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,679
at 11:56 a.m. Jon Jones was declared

466
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,280
dead the rescue teams had worked

467
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,640
tirelessly for 24 hours trying to free

468
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,080
Jon but his inverted position made it

469
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,960
impossible the Clock Was ticking and

470
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,640
Jon's time had run out John had spent an

471
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,080
extraordinary 27 hours in an inverted

472
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,720
position three times longer than

473
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,440
estimated the six Rescuers who actually

474
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,880
reached Jon were true heroes they placed

475
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,360
themselves in a part of the cave that

476
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,799
was not on the map and faced many known

477
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,840
dangers they demonstrated selflessness

478
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,039
in their efforts maintained a calm

479
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,600
demeanor and never gave up on what

480
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,440
seemed like an impossible rescue when it

481
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,520
was determined that recovering the body

482
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,880
would be impossible Jon was left in the

483
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,440
Nutty putty Cave's AIDS push section for

484
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,240
Eternal rest the entire cave system was

485
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,120
sealed with concrete to prevent any

486
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,520
further exploration a plaque was erected

487
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,520
there in memory of Jon Jones life
